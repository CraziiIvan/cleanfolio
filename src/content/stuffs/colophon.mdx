import Link from "@components/Link.astro";
import CodeBlock from "@components/CodeBlock.tsx";

Although I have been a developer for a long time, I have never built a personal website completely.

#### Inspiration

#### Tech stack
- Staticly generated with <Link href="https://astro.build/">Astro</Link>
- Most of styling is done with <Link href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</Link> and a bit of plain CSS
- Contents are written in <Link href="">MDX</Link>

<CodeBlock language="javascript" codeString={`function fabonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return 1;
  return fabonacci(n - 1) + fabonacci(n - 2);
}`} showLineNumbers={true} />
