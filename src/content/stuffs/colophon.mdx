import Link from "@components/Link.astro";
// import CodeBlock from "@components/CodeBlock.tsx";
import CodeBlock from "@components/CodeBlock.astro";

Although I have been a developer for a long time, I have never built a personal website completely.

#### Inspiration

#### Tech stack
- Staticly generated with <Link href="https://astro.build/">Astro</Link>
- Most of styling is done with <Link href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</Link> and a bit of plain CSS
- Contents are written in <Link href="">MDX</Link>

<CodeBlock
  snippet={`
\`\`\`ts {4-5} showLineNumbers 
import mdx from '@astrojs/mdx';
import tailwind from '@astrojs/tailwind';
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import rehypePrettyCode from 'rehype-pretty-code';
import moonlightTheme from './public/theme/moonlight-ii.json';
import { transformerCopyButton } from '@rehype-pretty/transformers';

export default defineConfig({
  markdown: {
    syntaxHighlight: false,
    rehypePlugins: [
      [
        rehypePrettyCode,
        {
          theme: moonlightTheme,
          transformers: [
            transformerCopyButton({
              visibility: 'hover',
              feedbackDuration: 3500,
            }),
          ],
        },
      ],
    ],
  },
  integrations: [mdx(), tailwind()],
});
\`\`\`
`}
/>
